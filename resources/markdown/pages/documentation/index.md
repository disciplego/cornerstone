### What is a Discovery Bible Study (DBS)?

> A Discovery Bible Study is a simple method of Disciple-Making to help you read and discuss scripture with others.

These Bible studies enable people to read the Bible for themselves and to discover Truth to put into action following Jesus. Easy to remember, simple questions encourage participants to discover and understand God’s character, humanity’s need for God, and how to obey and share that Truth with others.

The studies are most effective when read in small groups of 3 to 8 people.

### So how do you start a DBS?

Begin by praying for God to open doors of opportunity to reach those He is drawing by the Holy Spirit. Then simply invite someone to start a study with you.
